# Audio to Text 

Java CLI which uses the [AssemblyAI Service](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/getting-started/transcribe-an-audio-file) to convert audio to text. Giving credit to [YouTuber Coding with John](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingWithJohn)
I am interested in audio and sound so I followed his tutorial and created this small application.

This has introduced me to the AssemblyAI service. 
I have also gained knowledge about the [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) multimedia framework and how to use it on the command line to extract audio from video. I am working to include it directly into this application for ease and OneStop Shopping.

## Practical application

After completing the initial version of this app I failed to see any practical use other than I thought it was cool. However now that I have been adding videos to my website, I realize there is an accessability issue for the hearing impaired. So I am currently learning how to incorporate Closed Captioning into my videos with my next Java app.
