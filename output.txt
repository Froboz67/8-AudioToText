Welcome to my Spotify project which utilizes the awesome Spotify Web API Java library to take advantage of the deep content that is housed within side the Spotify service. Using Vue JS for a dynamic and elegant experience. I am most excited to have learned about the CSS clamp function which I've applied globally to provide responsive text sizing for great flow and visual aesthetic. Thanks for watching.
